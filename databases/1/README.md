# What?
Generally, a database is a program that persists and retrieves structured data.

# Why?
So you can persist and retrieve data. :P

# Example
You have a website. Users can write the best color. The best color is persisted and shown on each page load.

Read the example: `best_color_site.js` and then run it `node best_color_site.js`
